[My mom][mom] recently made a brief blog post about how [our artistic views are different][mblog]. I found the comparison that she made of our two photos really interesting. I think it is interesting because you can see how different our view of beauty in nature is and how we see things differently. So we may both agree that I currently take a more minimalistic approach to photography, but I would like to show how gorgeous her paintings are.

I think that painting is amazing, and I wish I had the patience and skill towards painting that she has.
