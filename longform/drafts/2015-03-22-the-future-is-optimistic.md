Interstellar is an interesting movie. It presents an interesting story, but above all, it presents an optimistic future. For works of Science Fiction of the last few years, this is actually a quite amazing proposition. We as humans, may not kill ourselves.

I found this oddly inspiring. There is now a dream in my brain where we might not kill off humanity. Interstellar suggests this will happen through a few very unusual circumstances, but it's still a flicker of hope. Another series that does this is "The Culture" series by Ian M. Banks. This series actually doesn't (at least as far as I've read) suggest humanity will be saved, but it also promotes an idea of positive future.
