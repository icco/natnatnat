I love the internet. The internet is a place where people can create amazing content and share it among their peers. They can [post a video of themselves singing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOFRZ1wNLw) and get a recording contact. They can create [art inspired by their favorite art](http://behindinfinity.deviantart.com/art/Death-Note-This-Is-Heaven-52682456) and share it with millions of people. They can [share fresh ideas](https://dribbble.com/shots?sort=recent) with their industry. Or whatever they want. Because in general, the internet is a place to allow for people to share content openly.

But lately, Instagram has decided it hates developers. Many sites on the internet let their users use web APIs to get machine parsable information about themselves and their followers. Some example sites that do this are [Twitter](), [Youtube](), [Flickr](), [Dribbble](), [DeviantArt]() and many others.

As of June 1st, 2016, Instagram has decided as a developer you can no longer get this information about yourself or other users. http://developers.instagram.com/post/133424514006/instagram-platform-update
