I have a lot of thoughts about the technology industry and its impact on United States Politics. But I would like to talk about some tweets I saw flying by on Election Night, November 8th, 2016.

The first I saw in a few different ways (and also saw in text messages and the like).

Silicon Valley should disrupt Washington D.C.

If this is something you agree with, then you haven't been paying attention. President Obama has been trying really hard to get technologists involved in US Politics. For example:

 - United States Presidential Innovation Fellows
 - United States Digital Service
 - code.gov
 - DefenseX
 - 18F

And then there are the organizations outside of the Federal Government, like Code for America and Timshel. 

These organizations have been trying to bring things like software written this decade, agile development, improved procurement processes and improved hiring practices.

But that was all just trying to lay the foundation, and we're no where near it. Very few people in tech want to be associated with the governemtn. For example, none of you worked for the DNC. No one helped protect them from being attacked from foreign entities.


ugh god I can't write this right now
