So I've been teaching myself rails while working on [bloomFilter][]. While exploring rails, I've debated about how I want to do comment nesting. The most common choice seems to be to use a ruby gem to build the functionality into rails. The two I have come across that seem to be most commonly used are [ancestry][] and [act_as_tree][].
