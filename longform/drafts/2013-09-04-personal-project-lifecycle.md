The late Irish poet [Seamus Heaney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus_Heaney) said: 

 > Getting started, keeping going, getting started again -- in art and in life, it seems to me this is the essential rhythm not only of achievement, but of survival, the ground of convinced action, the basis of self-esteem and the guarantee of credibility in your lives, credibility to yourselves as well as to others.

When thinking about the cycle in which I make things, I have trouble finding a quote that fits me better.
