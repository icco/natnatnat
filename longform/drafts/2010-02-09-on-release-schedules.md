Lately I've been bothered and impressed by a trend very common in three of the big internet companies: Twitter, Facebook and Google. These three trend setters have all been releasing new features on their site (or in google's case entire products) and only giving them to a subset of their users. Then over time slowly giving the new feature to the rest of their users.

While I think this does a few things very well for them, such a generate hype and give them essentially free beta testers, I feel it really hurts the users who aren't part of this select few.
