Everyone gather-round, I'm going to tell you the story of my first mission as a mentor for the [Recurse Center]()'s new program [RC Start]().

My first mentee was Andrew.

At our intro session we grabbed coffee and talked about ourselves for thirty minutes. I gave my background, and he gave his background and what he wanted to get out of RC Start.

At our first session, we talked about bootcamps, APIs, and how the internet works. We walked through one piece of code Andrew had written to figure out what he understood and what he had just copy-pasted. We talked about where to find documentation.

At our second session Andrew told me he had gotten into the bootcamp he wanted to. We walked through a larger piece of code he had written which was a javascript game. We talked about code organization, refactoring, linting, switch statements and programming culture.
