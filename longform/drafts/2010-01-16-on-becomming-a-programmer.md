I was digging around on an old hard drive of mine, and I found this quote. Not sure where it's from, besides the fact that the file was last written to on January 16th, 2010.

 > A long time ago, in a very distant land, I studied under a grey bearded master where he taught me the secrets of the ancient art of programming. We stood on our hands and programmed Fortran with our eyes closed. We programmed web servers with just a six switch in-board to a PDP-10.

At one point in my life, I believed in the idea that programming is a mystic art. Something to be handed down like an art style or kung-fu technique. But times they are a changing. These days I'm a bigger believer in learning from the work of others. [GitHub](http://github.com) has promoted this beyond belief.
