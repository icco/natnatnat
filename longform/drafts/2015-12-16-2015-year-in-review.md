Hiya! Thanks for coming to another year in the life of [Nat](http://natwelch.com) review, this time for 2015. You can see my reviews from [2014](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/524), [2013](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/521), [2012](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/513), [2011](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/507) and [2010](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/499) on this blog.

2015 was so insane, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around everything that happened. So, to keep this reasonable, let's go through every month and then recap at the end.

You can see [my entire 2015 in photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/sets/72157650347678131). Below is just a sampling of the photos that I took.

## January

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/15689404973/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="City of London"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8603/15689404973_15420be4ce_n.jpg" alt="City of London"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/15686478884/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Josh"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7491/15686478884_f6996a6eaf_n.jpg" alt="Josh"></a>

January was interesting. I spent a lot of the month thinking about what I wanted to do in 2016. I was unhappy in London. Part of it was career issues, others was just an inability to build a social support network. Looking back at it, I think I gave up a little too early, but I don't regret the time I spent in London or deciding to leave (regret isn't healthy). I spent a lot of time hanging out with Josh, who was in a similar spot in London. Americans lost in Europe.

Near the end of the month, I went to [Monkigras](http://monkigras.com/2015/01/30/monki-gras-day-1-lagom-achieved/). Monkigras was a fantastic experience, and a great setup for my traveling in February. I would recommend the conference to everyone interested in process, culture and software development. Shoutout to @monkchips, I've never met a friendlier person. We ended up talking for like an hour after the conference closed (I think this was the first conference I stayed at till like 1am). We bonded over the amazing music he setup, [The Franklys](http://www.thefranklys.com/), and the intimate setting he had created.

## February

At the very end of January (the day after Monkigras), I flew to Zurich. This is one of those trips I did not document as well as I should have, but was utterly amazing. I met coworkers I had been talking to for a long time on IRC finally in person, went to a spa with @reed, hiked all over the beautiful city, and experienced my first snow of the year.

February was packed with travel though. After Zurich, I was home in London for a while, and two of my favorite Googlers from Seattle visited.

And then for my birthday, I flew to Copenhagen to meet up with @niket, @mattjoanou, @GarrettMcManus and Jaymie. I stayed in a hotel that was a boat, continued wandering everywhere, drank a lot of [Mikkeller beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikkeller), and just generally chilled with friends. On my last day, Jaymie and I went to a concert with a random girl she met at her hostel. Such a great trip.

## March

By March, I had given notice at Google, and was planning my escape to NYC, where I would be attending Hacker School (more on that soon). Before I left I tried to explore last corners of London I had been putting off, and take lots of photos of coworkers and the like.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16204900644/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Robot on Whiteboard"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7284/16204900644_bab1c60bb3_n.jpg" alt="Robot on Whiteboard"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16883028635/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Coworkers!"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7609/16883028635_c2f9ef3d75_n.jpg" alt="Coworkers!"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16904085641/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Keith"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7624/16904085641_d68dc2863f_n.jpg" alt="Keith"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16675918917/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Matt and Pascal"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7588/16675918917_8cbe45cc6b_n.jpg" alt="Matt and Pascal"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16260841504/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Ingvar!"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8688/16260841504_bacf5fe1c0_n.jpg" alt="Ingvar!"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16285080433/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Toilet Quotes"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8696/16285080433_bde987ff88_n.jpg" alt="Toilet Quotes"></a>

I then did this crazy thing... so I shipped a bunch of my things to SF, which was gonna take two months, then I had a bunch of stuff I didn't ship. So I flew to SF, went to my parents house repacked a subset of my stuff into two small bags, spent an afternoon hanging out in the city with good friends (we went on a two mile walk, drank beer and ate tacos), and then flew to NYC. In total I was in the bay area for like 38 hours.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16704292517/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Friends"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8707/16704292517_8bbc19b410.jpg" alt="Friends"></a>

Then, I was in New York City. I purposely landed a few days before Recurse Center (which was [renamed from Hacker School](https://www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center) while I was traveling). The next three months are actually really well documented, because I [wrote every day](https://writing.natwelch.com/tags/recursecenter) for the three months I was attending RC. [Day 1](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/82) was my first post, and I started by spending the week catching up with friends who lived in NYC and exploring the city, trying to figure out what was going on and just decompress.

And then #recursecenter began!

## April

So RC Spring 2, 2015 actually began March 30th, but whatever. I cannot explain to you how overwhelmed I was during the month of April. I had no idea what I was doing, what was going on, or really where I was. The first week of RC, I just tried to do everything, and successfully burnt myself out. So I started slowing things down, wandering around New York a lot, and instead of trying to figure out what to do, I just started coding.

The second weekend in NY, RC planned a trip to [Storm King Art Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_King_Art_Center). This was one of my favorite art things I have seen in NY. Such a great trip, despite being a really long car drive.

One thing that I started doing almost every day was going on coffee walks. I saw lots of cool parts of downtown NY with Recursers, and drank way too much coffee.

## May

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/16762895894/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="street art"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8823/16762895894_b59d869fe9_z.jpg" alt="street art"></a>

In May, six weeks in to my time at RC, half of the people left (RC works where batches overlap by six weeks), and we got a week off, and my family visited me. Lots more wandering with people from RC, by myself and with my family.

My uncle Bob passed away during this time as well, so I took a trip down to Philadelphia for his funeral.

And I also attended this amazing conference on Video Games and Art called [two5six](http://2015.two5six.com/).

## June

Ok, so May and April were both insane whirlwinds. June, my last month at RC, I figure, sure, now things will settle down. They didn't really. I started the month off by flying back to SF for my brother's graduation from High School. I took some time and saw some friends as well.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/18509081761/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Travis: Graduate Edition"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/306/18509081761_60938f969c.jpg" alt="Travis: Graduate Edition"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/18887399352/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Xander, Le and Kareem"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/417/18887399352_0318b1e44c_n.jpg" alt="Xander, Le and Kareem"></a>

When I returned, I had two visitors: @beurredoux and @markgius.

And then lots more RC, wandering and exploring.

Oh one pretty cool highlight from the month was being able to go inside the New York Stock Exchange! Thanks Recurse Center!

I really skimmed over the time I spent inside RC. It was a crazy experience and I would recommend it to most programmers. I wrote a [Return Statement](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/401) on my time there, and it has a much more indepth look at my time specifically at RC.

## July

On July 2nd, my batch officially ended, and I flew home a day later. When I came home I had a pallet of stuff from London to go through. So a lot of my time was spent going through that, plus lots of other stuff I had left with my parents when I left SF the first time.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/19417328702/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="3D Tetris"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/351/19417328702_620efc3fd6.jpg" alt="3D Tetris"></a>

I went up to the cabin twice, plus spent a bunch of time hanging out in SF trying to see people. I didn't get to see everyone I know and love, but I did a pretty good job.

## August

In August, I moved to NYC. I say moved, because this time, I actually signed a lease with @rohenp and shipped 300 pounds of my stuff there.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/20283397338/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="All of my stuff made it to NYC!"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/391/20283397338_5b202274a3_m.jpg" alt="All of my stuff made it to NYC!"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/20194670088/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="New window view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/399/20194670088_968e5f157e_m.jpg" alt="New window view"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21818727261/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="2015-08-06_edited"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5625/21818727261_8fab2080fa_m.jpg" alt="2015-08-06_edited"></a>

The first few days a got back to wandering: I saw [a concert](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/watkins-family-hour/2015/lincoln-center-damrosch-park-new-york-ny-4bf7a7c6.html) with Rohen, I visited RC, I ate thai food.

But then, the foolery stopped, and I started my new job at [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc)!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/20825589065/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Littlebits"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/703/20825589065_cf4cf8c86d.jpg" alt="Littlebits"></a>

## September

At the end of August, and begining of September, I flew over to Seattle to do a trip I've been wanting to do for a while. I started off by going to [PAX Prime 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Arcade_Expo) (which I think was my eighth time attending) in downtown Seattle. I also took the chance to visit some Googlers and some Recursers in Seattle (most of whom I forgot to take photos of... fail). Shout out to Mark and Tracy for putting me up in their new home, it was a blast.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21621358818/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="PAX Badges"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/620/21621358818_6b31c77302_m.jpg" alt="PAX Badges"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21818758191/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Sushi Party"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/572/21818758191_742f9c5a78_m.jpg" alt="Sushi Party"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21809270135/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Mark eats Burrito"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/714/21809270135_b407719dc1_m.jpg" alt="Mark eats Burrito"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21186523274/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Chris eats Burrito"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5763/21186523274_9de5ff10fb_m.jpg" alt="Chris eats Burrito"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21188165963/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Link"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5669/21188165963_6898d12140_m.jpg" alt="Link"></a> <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/21621362118/in/album-72157650347678131/" title="Bill, Bruce and Pascal"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5812/21621362118_c3ebc5c70d_m.jpg" alt="Bill, Bruce and Pascal"></a>

I then took the train up to Vancouver to visit @kenpratt, a fellow Recurser. This solved a life long want to visit Canada which I some how never made happen before this year (maybe next year I'll finally go to Mexico). Vancouver is such a beautiful city. I don't think you'd have to do much to convince me to move there. Such great food, sights and my favorite type of weather (mild and wet).

I then took the train down to Portland to visit my buddy @AlbertusMagnus! I've known Chris since 2002 (he was the first friend I made in High School) and hanging out with him in his home of Portland was a blast.

I then flew back to NY... for a little bit. Halfway through the month I attended @namniart's wedding in sunny Santa Rosa.

It was by far the nerdiest wedding I had ever been to, but it was just about perfect. I'm so happy for these two wonderful people.

At the end of Septmeber, I went to Makerfaire NYC and worked the Littlebits booth there.

## October

Matt stopped by NY in the beginning of the month, and we went out with @chris_nolte, @farzadallday and a few others and partied in the Lower East Side, which was a blast.

Later in the week, a coworker Kristin shared tickets with me to go see Stars in Brooklyn. It was such an amazing show!

Later in the month, Rohen and I followed @nicholasbs's advice, and attended the [Gowanus Open Studios](http://artsgowanus.org/gowanus-open-studios-2015) which was cool. So much good art. I didn't take any photos except for this quote though...

I continued to work for littleBits

and I continued to wander (surprising no one...)

## November

At the begining of November, my Mom, Dad and I traveled to Urbana, Illinois to visit my brother during his first semester of university at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne. Travis gave us a tour of the university and we all hung out for a day.

## December


## The whole year...

My goals for 2015...

I listened to a lot of music (Generated by [Last.FM Playground](http://playground.last.fm/demo/listeningtrends)):

[![Nat's 2014 in music](/images/2015/12/lastfm2015.png)](/images/2014/12/lastfm2014.pdf)

And wrote a lot of open source code:

[![Nat's 2014 in code](/images/2015/12/commits.png)](http://code.natwelch.com)

And I flew a ton of miles! [Cemre created this cool app](http://cem.re/year-in-review/ebeeeb2687bccb89e05a58238c904e271e0fced9.html) to graph them all:

[![nats flights](/images/2015/12/flights_thumb.png)](/images/2015/12/flights.png)

And even read [42 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/1196204).

## Next year I plan to...

Figure out a way to build and ship products as part of my job. I really miss creating things for a living, and I am pretty sure it's the basis for a lot of my stress, so I am going to focus on getting that right. I still haven't turned that into OKRs, but I'm working on it, and will have a post out about that as well soon-ish.

Happy New Year!<br />
