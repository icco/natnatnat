Hiya! Thanks for coming to another year in the life of Nat review, this time for 2015. You can see my reviews from [2014](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/524), [2013](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/521), [2012](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/513), [2011](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/507) and [2010](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/499) on this blog.

2015 was so insane, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around everything that happened. So, to keep this reasonable, let's go through every month and then recap at the end.

You can see [my entire 2015 in photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/sets/72157650347678131). Below is just a sampling of the photos that I took.

My goals for 2015

 * 

I listened to a lot of music (Generated by [Last.FM Playground](http://playground.last.fm/demo/listeningtrends)):

[![Nat's 2014 in music](/images/2014/12/lastfm2014.png)](/images/2014/12/lastfm2014.pdf)

And wrote a lot of open source code:

And I flew a ton of miles! [Cemre created this cool app](http://cem.re/year-in-review/ebeeeb2687bccb89e05a58238c904e271e0fced9.html) to graph them all:

And even read [42 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/1196204).

## Next year I plan to...

Figure out a way to build and ship products as part of my job. I really miss creating things for a living, and I am pretty sure it's the basis for a lot of my stress, so I am going to focus on getting that right. I still haven't turned that into OKRs, but I'm working on it, and will have a post out about that as well soon-ish.

Happy New Year!<br />
