Ok, so, I made this resolution to try building things using the [100:10:1](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) pattern. So here is a list of one hundred ideas of things I could build out. Note that throughout this post, I could easily replace the words "web site" with "app" and vice versa.

 * A web site for promoting building things in two month stints, ala Strip Search
 * A web site for sharing project ideas to inspire people
 * Another TODO website
 * An RSS reader focused on giving you five articles a day that you have to read
 * A meal planning and sharing site
 * A sinatra-esque task queue
 * A service focused on making it easy for people to create and host static sites
 * A javascript story game, kind of like something teltale would make
 * An OKR website
 * An online dictionary that imitates the ease of access of a normal dictionary
 * A project idea generator
 * A site that teaches you one random thing a day
 * A slack bot that shares all of the blog posts and tweets and photos members of a slack make
 * An alarm clock that doesn't try too hard to wake you up
 * A website for sharing playlists
 * A Heroku clone
 * Given a soundcloud playlist, generate a youtube video
 * A game that teaches you math through text messages
 * Add more languages to hound.ci
 * A starfox shooter clone with dubstep
 * A script that mirrors your entire twitter history into a git repo
 * A go clone of jrnl.sh
 * An android client for DayOne
 * A site that recommends what book to read next based on your to-read list and what book you finished recently on Goodreads
 * A go IRC bot
 * A tool for coordinating D&D campaigns
 * A site that scrapes all of your social media and gives you a historical look at what you did on a day by day basis
 * A simple monitoring app that takes a list of urls and starts monitoring them over time.
 * A lock server built on top of the block chain
 * A good voice recorder for Android
 * A web indexer and crawler
 * A personal internet archive
 * A mail box flood website. Give us money and an address, and we'll send them mail with exponentially more mail over time until the mail runs out.
 * Give an address and $2, get a generated piece of art in the mail
 * Poetry generator
 * College admission essay generator
 * Implement ntp client in javascript
 * Code review tool with genius.com type annotating
 * A version of hound.ci that sends pull requests to fix issues
 * a bot net that joins IRC channels and starts having discussions arguing about politics and religion at the level of drunk high school students
 * a site that acts as a virus to share all episodes ever published of essential mix
 * a dating app with no pictures or demographic information
 * a matrix type message board that is completely annoymous
 * reimplement the anxiety box http://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-anxiety-box/
 * generate random city maps
 * progress bar game, the online website
 * pandora for youtube
 * Opensource itunes clone
 * opensource dropbox
 * Raspberry pi mesh network for sharing files
 * Android app for mapping wi-fi access points
 * Build some sort of social bot http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/sunday-review/i-flirt-and-tweet-follow-me-at-socialbot.html
 * A video game about a mech-warrior road trip
 * A video game about gandalf in tokyo
 * a video game of neuromancer meets zelda
 * some sort of ARG around delivering packages to people using mobile phones and BLE
 * Somehow mix something like the listening post (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD36IajCz6A) and gameplay
 * A map of the world that uses a fog of war and foursquare checkins to show you where you have been and where you haven't 
 * a site that summarizes movies by the colors they use
 * Porn + Twilio translation API = comedy?
 * A book sharing website. Like a library but online
 * A site for sharing timelines
 * An app for chronicling all of the friends in your life. The book from Hunger Games + https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends
