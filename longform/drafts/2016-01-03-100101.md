Ok, so, I made this resolution to try building things using the [100:10:1]() pattern. So here is a list of one hundred ideas of things I could build out.

 * A web site for promoting building things in two month stints, ala Strip Search
 * A web site for sharing project ideas to inspire people
 * Another TODO website
 * An RSS reader focused on giving you five articles a day that you have to read
 * A meal planning and sharing site
 * A sinatra-esque task queue
 * A service focused on making it easy for people to create and host static sites
 * A javascript story game, kind of like something teltale would make
 * An OKR website
 * An online dictionary that imitates the ease of access of a normal dictionary
 * A project idea generator
 * A site that teaches you one random thing a day
 * A slack bot that shares all of the blog posts and tweets and photos members of a slack make
 * An alarm clock that doesn't try too hard to wake you up
 * A website for sharing playlists
 * A Heroku clone
 * Given a soundcloud playlist, generate a youtube video
 * A game that teaches you math through text messages
 * Add more languages to hound.ci
 * A starfox shooter clone with dubstep
 * A script that mirrors your entire twitter history into a git repo
 * A go clone of jrnl.sh
 * An android client for DayOne
 * A site that recommends what book to read next based on your to-read list and what book you finished recently on Goodreads
 * A go IRC bot
 * A tool for coordinating D&D campaigns
 * A site that scrapes all of your social media and gives you a historical look at what you did on a day by day basis
 * A simple monitoring app that takes a list of urls and starts monitoring them over time.
 * A lock server built on top of the block chain
 * A good voice recorder for Android
 * A web indexer and crawler
 * A personal internet archive
