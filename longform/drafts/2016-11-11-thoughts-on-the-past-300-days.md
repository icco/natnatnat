I do not know if I am ready to write this yet, but I received some advice on Thursday, and I want to both pass it on and act on it. The two pieces of advice were from someone whom I respect greatly, who prefers not be named.

The advice is as follows:

 1. Get comfortable with and constantly use end to end encryption.
 2. Write down everything you experienced so you can remember it for next time.

Day 300 is Sunday, November 13, 2016. Five days after Election Day 2016: November 8th. It's 300 days since I started working on Hillary for America, the campaign to elect Hillary Clinton as the first female president of the United States of America. To address my time on the campaign, I want to write three posts.

 1. The Primary
 2. The Convention
 3. The General

For people in politics, this is normal. For people in tech, many don't realize how things flow, where the stress is, what the problems are. I have learned a lot about this I want to write down so I can refer back to it again. Why? Because even if I don't do this again (which I think I would), someone else will, and sharing with them will only make them stronger (#strongertogether).

I loved this campaign, but it showed me some truths that I didn't think I would have to confront. I burn out easily. My understanding of security was sub-par to what is needed these days. People outside of tech really do not understand what I do for a living. Some people have a lot of hatred in America.

Outside of those harsh realities though, I learned that you can have an effect in government. We may not have won, but I am very convinced that individuals can have an effect at the federal level, which is not something I believed as recent as 2014. So by the end of the year, I hope to have those three posts out, trying to explain how I feel and what I saw.

Beyond writing, the other piece of advice is end-to-end encryption. I do this in a lot of places, but still only about 30% of my internet traffic is that way. I need to sit down and audit my habits and lock down my shit. Then, I need to lock down my family's communications. I don't know if tools are tru;y tjere yet though. I think I now want to try get VPNs to a state where they are one button press and every one iset tp use.
