Hello hello hello!

Thanks for coming to another review of a year in the life of [Nat](http://natwelch.com). This time we will be revisiting 2016.

You can see past reviews from [2015](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/531), [2014](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/524), [2013](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/521), [2012](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/513), [2011](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/507) and [2010](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/499) on this blog.

To create this review, I went through [my entire 2016 in photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/albums/72157663294803771), and then added flavor text.

## January

I started January right here, sitting in cabin on Lake Almanor. In December, I had interviewed and accepted a job at [Hillary for America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016). In the begining of January, I quit my job at [LittleBits](http://littlebits.cc/), and on January 18th, started at Hillary for America HQ in Brooklyn Heights.

This was also my first real winter on the East Coast. Got used to commuting in the snow, for whatever that's worth.

## February

So when I started at the campaign, I started working seven days a week. I don't have a lot of photos of this time, but on February 1st, we had our first election in Iowa. It only got crazier from there.

I was dating Diana at the time, whom I really only saw Wednesday nights. For some reason, consistently, Wednesday was the only night life was at all sane.

On my birthday, I took my first vacation since I started working on the campaign, and took two days off. One of which I hung out in museums, the other I spent hanging with Diana.

## March

I made it one year in New York! I didn't really have time to notice though. During March there were elections almost every day, so there was a lot of waiting, celebrating and long nights.

I did get a chance to see a wonderful panel at the Whitney on the Freedom of Information Act and how it has affected working Journalists and how people use it today.

Oh and Travis came to visit for a week!

Finally, I don't have any photos of it, but the campaign did it's first hackathon the last weekend in March. It was one of my favorite weekends on the campaign, because I got to work with new people, play with some new tech, and try and solve a big problem.

## April

Let's start with the important thing: I was on TV.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/26323331446/in/album-72157663294803771/" title="Television Debut"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1591/26323331446_049e5dc7ec_n.jpg" width="320" height="205" alt="Television Debut"></a>

An episode aired of [The Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circus:_Inside_the_Greatest_Political_Show_on_Earth) where they had filmed in the HFA office while Howard Dean was speaking. Myself and a few tech people were in a shot. I didn't put together [an IMDB page like the campaign dog](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8117711/), but it was still a blast.

The rest of the month, I finally started taking more photos at work. We had lots of fun visitors and I started to really feel like I understood what was going on.

I also got some more time off and got to see the amazing [YOUARENOWHERE](http://andrewjs.com/work/youarenowhere/) thanks to [Sumana](https://www.harihareswara.net/).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/26082221890/in/album-72157663294803771/" title="#youarenowhere"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1482/26082221890_008aeca196_n.jpg" width="320" height="320" alt="#youarenowhere"></a>

The downside of all of this is at the beginning of the month I broke up with Diana, so I was back to the single game.

## May

In May, the campaign was slowly starting to become normal. I had some days off and we felt like we had the nomination in the bag. [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) hosted their annual "Never Graduate Week", and while I didn't get to hang out at a ton of it, I did get to see lots of RC people I love:

Rohen and I went to the Whitney Curatorial Address. We were the youngest people there, but it was one of the more fascinating things I've been to. The curators talked about everything they had planned for the year and all of the decisions that went into building the museum. So much fun!

In May, I got to meet Bill and Hillary Clinton!

When I started on the campaign, I said I had three goals:

 - Shake hands with Bill Clinton.
 - Hug Hillary Clinton.
 - See Hillary elected President.

In May, I shook hands with them both, and got to talk to Hillary Clinton a little about what I did on the campaign, so I viewed that as two bullet points crossed off. Also, notice the Tech team keeps growing!

At the end of May, I took a four day weekend and visited Washington, D.C. I hadn't really ever felt like I had touristed the city, and after the campaign, if it went well, I was thinking of moving to D.C. to work on the [USDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Digital_Service) or try and get a job with [the CTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Technology_Officer_of_the_United_States). I last was in D.C. in 2010 for [the Rally to Restore Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_to_Restore_Sanity_and/or_Fear) with @Madrox and @markgius, and I had visited once before when I was super young, but after this trip, I felt like I at least understood the basics of the city. Shoutout to Pheonix for hanging out.

## June

June was an insane month.

I went on my first date with @mel_cantrell to a [Thundercat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundercat_(musician)) show. It was an amazing show. I only wish he hadn't started two hours late. The upside was dating Melissa was one of the best things to happen to me in 2016!

Overall, June was a wonderful month. It wasn't too hot, I had every weekend off, and it was the calm between the Primaries and the Convention. I tried to do as much as humanly possible!

## July

July. July was this crazy mad dash to the Convention. We launched so much software in July, I can't even remember it all. July was wonderful, a celebration of everything we had done since I started, but also when the national eye really turned to the campaign and things got intense. We went back to seven days a week, and in my humble oppinion, did an amazing job.

## August

August was the last calm moment I can remember in 2016. We were still working hard, but we had time off here and there, and it was all sort of idyllic.

One of my favorite things in August was Melissa and I went and saw [Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology](http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina). One of my the things I don't talk about often is how much I love fashion. I'm not a huge consumer of it, but growing up around my mom who was always making clothes, knitting, weaving, embroidering, I somehow always thought about it. One of my favorite things about being in New York (and London for that matter) was how present the fashion industry is in the city. This exhibit was a celebration of the history and technological advances of that industry, and I had so much fun. The hilarious thing, we didn't even know it was still open. Melissa and I just wanted to go to the Met on our last day off in August.

Finally on the last day of August, we had a party at the home of [Richard Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott). I took a ton of photos, it was a great night just to talk and stare at famous stuff on the walls. Richard was an amazing host, and a truly fantastic collector.

## September

September was apparently spent eating. Ops did a celebratory dinner, I went out to eat with fellow staff folks, Melissa and I celebrated her birthday, etc. Oh and Aaron took me to see the U.S. Open! That was fun.

## October

At the end of September, and the beginning of October, I made a quick little jaunt to D.C. for work. It was... illuminating? Thanks to timball for letting me crash at his place and for the warm hospitality of all of the Sunlighters I met.

October was probably the longest month of 2016. Looking at these photos, I often go "that was October?!?". Lots of work as we tried to get millions registered to vote and remind people that Donald Trump is a fascist who will ruin your life, and that Hillary Clinton wants a better life for all people. Also, I got really sick at one point. And not to be forgotten or outdone, the amazing @pliable came and visited!

I'd like to also call out the amazing "Pear Bonus". At Google there was this thing called "Peer Bonuses", where you could pretty much tell Google to give any other employee $250 when they did a good job. It was wonderful. A great way to say "Hey! You're awesome. Go have a nice dinner." Krista and @PritikaN took that idea and invented the wonderful "Pear Bonuses". It's the same idea, but since the campaign has very little money, you instead give each other pears. timball and I both received them in October. It made me feel nice.

## November

I spent the first week of November working harder than I have in a long time. I was mentally exhausted, sleep deprived, angry and just overall emotional. I spent the next three weeks drunk, crying, sleeping and trying to get some work done. There were lots of long walks in parks. Lots of awkward meetings. Strange text messages with friends. It was a weird month. I overall liked 2016, but November 2016 is probably in the top five worst months I have ever experienced.

That being said, I will never forget it. November solidified relationships. November was when I spent time with people I didn't know before 2016, and now whom I would give up my bed for, or answer a phone call for at any hour. If you worked on Hillary for America, and I'm being 100% serious here, even if I never said one word to you, if you are hungry, I will feed you. If you need money, I will give it to you. If you need a place to sleep, my door is open. If you need to rant, my ear is available at the nearest bar, coffee shop, park bench, phone call, email or video chat. You've given so much, I could never begin to repay it. But I will do my best.

## December


## The whole year...

TODO

I can't seem to find my goals for 2015... probably proof of how lost I was in January. The only thing I have written down is to "figure out a way to build and ship products as part of my job". I don't think I actually did this... which is a little frustrating. I did complete my goals at RC, completing five projects. Going back to a document I wrote at the beginning of 2015, I sketched out some priorities for what I wanted in a career in 2015.

 * Build stuff people use daily
 * Have a source of creative outlet
 * Promote creativity and communication
 * Work with people who inspire me
 * Work with people who I can learn from

RC being one quarter of 2015 easily fulfilled four out of five of these goals. Nothing in the first or third quarters really touched on these goals, but my some of my time at littleBits in the fourth quarter has made progress on these wants.

If I look at my goals for 2014, I had goals around physical health, travel and art. This year I traveled to three cities I had never been to before: Copenhagen, Zurich and Vancouver. I traveled to three cities I hadn't been to in a while: Portland, New York and Philadelphia. My physical health didn't really improve. I still haven't gotten back to the 2013 level of the gym twice a week, but I didn't gain any weight. My general endurance did decrease though, I can no longer run a mile easily, and definitely not under ten minutes. As for art, I took around eight hundred and fifty photos. Less than last year, but an amount I am comfortable with. I also created a bunch of websites I like, and I've been writing in my journal more, so I'd view that as a success.

Moving away from goals, I measured a bunch of other parts of my life.

I listened to a lot of music. Sadly Last.FM got rid of the [stream graphs](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/) I loved using for displaying my year end listening trends. Instead some statistics according to [my Last.FM](http://www.last.fm/user/icco). I had 21,143 scrobbles this year (which is tracks played and recorded). Broken up by month:

![monthly scrobbles](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/monthly_scrobbles.png)

And the top artists I listened to this year:

![top artists](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/top_artists.png)

I wrote a lot of open source code, although my Autumn wasn't very productive.

[![Nat's 2015 in code](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/commits.png)](http://code.natwelch.com)

I even read [70 books](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/3082-2015-reading-challenge), continuing my yearly trend of reading more books each year! Goodreads.com actually did a really cool breakdown of my reading with their new feature, [Nat's year in books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/12680-nat).

What I'm particularly stoked on is I am continuing a trend of solid growth in number of books read. This growth is not sustainable, but if I stayed around this area of five to six books a month, I'd be stoked.

## Next year

OK, after my failure of goal setting in 2015, I'm going to try and flush out solid goals for 2016. The best goals, in my opinion, are measurable, so here are some measurable ones:

 - Lose thirty pounds of weight
 - Be active (elevated heart rate) for two hours per week on average
 - Take in revenue from one side project
 - Travel to five cities you haven't been to before, or at least not in five years.
 - Read seventy books

My final goal I haven't quite figured out yet. But I want to delve into a large side project. Something more ambitious than I have ever done. I'm thinking of it as my stretch goal for 2016. I've been thinking a lot about using [100:10:1](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) to figure out what this thing is. If I do start on this (which I should) I want to blog about it more. Just share my progress often, like I did with my posts during RC.

Anyways, thanks for reading! Feel free to send me feedback @icco or nat@natwelch.com

Happy New Year!
