Hello hello hello!

Thanks for coming to another review of a year in the life of [Nat](http://natwelch.com). This time we will be revisiting 2016.

You can see past reviews from [2015](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/531), [2014](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/524), [2013](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/521), [2012](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/513), [2011](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/507) and [2010](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/499) on this blog.

To create this review, I went through [my entire 2016 in photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/albums/72157663294803771), and then added flavor text.

## January

I started January right here, sitting in cabin on Lake Almanor. In December, I had interviewed and accepted a job at [Hillary for America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016). In the begining of January, I quit my job at [LittleBits](http://littlebits.cc/), and on January 18th, started at Hillary for America HQ in Brooklyn Heights.

This was also my first real winter on the East Coast. Got used to commuting in the snow, for whatever that's worth.

## February

So when I started at the campaign, I started working seven days a week. I don't have a lot of photos of this time, but on February 1st, we had our first election in Iowa. It only got crazier from there.

I was dating Diana at the time, whom I really only saw Wednesday nights. For some reason, consistently, Wednesday was the only night life was at all sane.

On my birthday, I took my first vacation since I started working on the campaign, and took two days off. One of which I hung out in museums, the other I spent hanging with Diana.

## March

I made it one year in New York! I didn't really have time to notice though. During March there were elections almost every day, so there was a lot of waiting, celebrating and long nights.

I did get a chance to see a wonderful panel at the Whitney on the Freedom of Information Act and how it has affected working Journalists and how people use it today.

TODO

I can't seem to find my goals for 2015... probably proof of how lost I was in January. The only thing I have written down is to "figure out a way to build and ship products as part of my job". I don't think I actually did this... which is a little frustrating. I did complete my goals at RC, completing five projects. Going back to a document I wrote at the beginning of 2015, I sketched out some priorities for what I wanted in a career in 2015.

 * Build stuff people use daily
 * Have a source of creative outlet
 * Promote creativity and communication
 * Work with people who inspire me
 * Work with people who I can learn from

RC being one quarter of 2015 easily fulfilled four out of five of these goals. Nothing in the first or third quarters really touched on these goals, but my some of my time at littleBits in the fourth quarter has made progress on these wants.

If I look at my goals for 2014, I had goals around physical health, travel and art. This year I traveled to three cities I had never been to before: Copenhagen, Zurich and Vancouver. I traveled to three cities I hadn't been to in a while: Portland, New York and Philadelphia. My physical health didn't really improve. I still haven't gotten back to the 2013 level of the gym twice a week, but I didn't gain any weight. My general endurance did decrease though, I can no longer run a mile easily, and definitely not under ten minutes. As for art, I took around eight hundred and fifty photos. Less than last year, but an amount I am comfortable with. I also created a bunch of websites I like, and I've been writing in my journal more, so I'd view that as a success.

Moving away from goals, I measured a bunch of other parts of my life.

I listened to a lot of music. Sadly Last.FM got rid of the [stream graphs](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/) I loved using for displaying my year end listening trends. Instead some statistics according to [my Last.FM](http://www.last.fm/user/icco). I had 21,143 scrobbles this year (which is tracks played and recorded). Broken up by month:

![monthly scrobbles](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/monthly_scrobbles.png)

And the top artists I listened to this year:

![top artists](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/top_artists.png)

I wrote a lot of open source code, although my Autumn wasn't very productive.

[![Nat's 2015 in code](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/commits.png)](http://code.natwelch.com)

I even read [70 books](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/3082-2015-reading-challenge), continuing my yearly trend of reading more books each year! Goodreads.com actually did a really cool breakdown of my reading with their new feature, [Nat's year in books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/12680-nat).

![year in books](https://writing.natwelch.com/images/2015/12/yearinbooks.png)

What I'm particularly stoked on is I am continuing a trend of solid growth in number of books read. This growth is not sustainable, but if I stayed around this area of five to six books a month, I'd be stoked.

## Next year

OK, after my failure of goal setting in 2015, I'm going to try and flush out solid goals for 2016. The best goals, in my opinion, are measurable, so here are some measurable ones:

 - Lose thirty pounds of weight
 - Be active (elevated heart rate) for two hours per week on average
 - Take in revenue from one side project
 - Travel to five cities you haven't been to before, or at least not in five years.
 - Read seventy books

My final goal I haven't quite figured out yet. But I want to delve into a large side project. Something more ambitious than I have ever done. I'm thinking of it as my stretch goal for 2016. I've been thinking a lot about using [100:10:1](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) to figure out what this thing is. If I do start on this (which I should) I want to blog about it more. Just share my progress often, like I did with my posts during RC.

Anyways, thanks for reading! Feel free to send me feedback @icco or nat@natwelch.com

Happy New Year!
