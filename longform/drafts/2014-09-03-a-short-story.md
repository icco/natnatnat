I look out the window to see the northern lights. Lines drawn in the sky, then blurred upwards to the sky. Our flight is guided by another, slowly following the blur upwards, towards the stars.

These wings. I close my eyes and I see the metal wings of my youth. Dreams of simple flights, city to city, across the night sky, staring out the window, headphones hiding the shuffling noises of my fellow passengers. Now, these wings are made of some material invented from thin air by educated women in pristine lab coats in coastal metropolises trying to defy laws written by previous men, millennia prior. Our fuselage, made of some other equally fantastic material insulates us as we rip through the atmospheres, leaving the snaking lights below us.

I slide my thumb along the side of my index finger, and the volume of my music lowers. The cabin only has one other passenger, whose breathing is silent as she sleeps. I hear not the rush of wind outside or the roar of engines. No rolling robots or water boiling. I lean back in my seat, rub my fingers the opposite way, and listen to the beats that only I can hear, reverberate in my head.

Why are we on this flight for two, sliding into the thin night sky? I am still unclear myself. A letter arrived two days ago, inviting me to receive an award from a society of engineers whom I have never heard of.
